Quickstart for new contributors

1. Read the high level docs:
	- `docs/project-spec.md` — product requirements (SRD)
	- `docs/backend-architecture-spec.md` — architecture and conventions
2. Follow the developer setup guide: `docs/developer-setup.md` (includes commands to run tests and a local MySQL instance)
3. The OpenAPI contract is the source of truth for endpoints and payloads — see `docs/oas.yml`.

If you are contributing code, please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the PR and testing workflow.

If you are using an AI assistant (Copilot/other) to generate code or tests, please read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` first — it contains repository-specific constraints and examples.
